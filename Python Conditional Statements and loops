1. Write a Python program to find those numbers which are divisible by 7 and multiple of 5, between 1500 and 2700 (both included).

Sol.
num = []
for x in range(1500, 2701):
  if (x%5==0) and (x%7==0):
     num.append(str(x))
print (','.join(num))


2. Write a Python program to convert temperatures to and from celsius, fahrenheit.
[ Formula : c/5 = f-32/9 [ where c = temperature in celsius and f = temperature in fahrenheit ]
Expected Output :
60°C is 140 in Fahrenheit
45°F is 7 in Celsius 

Sol.
temp = input("Input the  temperature you like to convert? (e.g., 50F, 104C etc.) : ")
degree = int(temp[:-1])
i_convention = temp[-1]

if i_convention.upper() == "C":
  result = int(round((9 * degree) / 5 + 32))
  o_convention = "Fahrenheit"
elif i_convention.upper() == "F":
  result = int(round((degree - 32) * 5 / 9))
  o_convention = "Celsius"
else:
  print("Input proper convention.")
  quit()
print("The temperature in", o_convention, "is", result, "degrees.")


3. Write a Python program to guess a number between 1 to 9.
Note : User is prompted to enter a guess. If the user guesses wrong then the prompt appears again until the guess is correct, 
on successful guess, user will get a "Well guessed!" message, and the program will exit.

Sol.
import random
target_num, guess_num = random.randint(1,10), 0
while target_num != guess_num:
  guess_num = int (input('Guess a number between 1 to 10 until you get it right: '))
print ('Well Guessed!')
