1. Write a Python program to find those numbers which are divisible by 7 and multiple of 5, between 1500 and 2700 (both included).

Sol.
num = []
for x in range(1500, 2701):
  if (x%5==0) and (x%7==0):
     num.append(str(x))
print (','.join(num))


2. Write a Python program to convert temperatures to and from celsius, fahrenheit.
[ Formula : c/5 = f-32/9 [ where c = temperature in celsius and f = temperature in fahrenheit ]
Expected Output :
60°C is 140 in Fahrenheit
45°F is 7 in Celsius 

Sol.
temp = input("Input the  temperature you like to convert? (e.g., 50F, 104C etc.) : ")
degree = int(temp[:-1])
i_convention = temp[-1]

if i_convention.upper() == "C":
  result = int(round((9 * degree) / 5 + 32))
  o_convention = "Fahrenheit"
elif i_convention.upper() == "F":
  result = int(round((degree - 32) * 5 / 9))
  o_convention = "Celsius"
else:
  print("Input proper convention.")
  quit()
print("The temperature in", o_convention, "is", result, "degrees.")


3. Write a Python program to guess a number between 1 to 9.
Note : User is prompted to enter a guess. If the user guesses wrong then the prompt appears again until the guess is correct, 
on successful guess, user will get a "Well guessed!" message, and the program will exit.

Sol.
import random
target_num, guess_num = random.randint(1,10), 0
while target_num != guess_num:
  guess_num = int (input('Guess a number between 1 to 10 until you get it right: '))
print ('Well Guessed!')

4. Write a Python program to construct the following pattern, using a nested for loop.

* * * 
* * * * 
* * * * * 
* * * * * * 
* * * * *

Sol.
n= 6;
for i in range(n):
  for j in range (i):
    print ('* ', end="")
  print('')

for i in range (n, 0, -1):
  for J in range (i):
    print('* ', end="")
  print('')


5. Write a Python program that accepts a word from the user and reverse it.
sol.

word = input ("Type a word which you want to reverse: ")

# Using extended slice syntax
def reverse(word):
  word = word[::-1]
  return word
print (reverse(word))

"""
# Using for loop
def reverse(word):
  str = ""
  for i in word:
    str = i + str
  return str
print (reverse(word))
"""

6. Check if provided number is Prime number or not?
Sol.

n = int(input("Enter the number you want to check for Prime:"))
if n > 1:
  # Check from 2 to n-1
  for i in range (2, n):
    if (n % i)==0:
      print(n, "is not a Prime Number")
      break
  else:
      print(n, "is a prime Number")
  
  # If input number is less than or equal to 1, it's not a prime number
else:
  print(n, "is not a prime Nmuber")
  
  
7. Print the Prime numbers between a provided range. 
Sol.

for num in range(2,101):
    prime = True
    for i in range(2,num):
        if (num%i==0):
            prime = False
    if prime:
       print (num)
   
8. Show the grade an student gained in Physics, Chemistry, and Maths exam. Do not execute the code further, if the student has failed in
   any subject. Minimum passing marks is 35. 

maths = int(input("Please enter the marks you have gain in Maths Exam: "))
physics = int(input("Please enter the marks you have gain in Physics Exam: "))
chemistry = int(input("Please enter the marks you have gain in Chemistry Exam: "))

if maths < 35 or physics < 35 or chemistry < 35:
    print("You are Fail")
else:
    print("Great!Lets Calculate the average then")
    avg=(maths+physics+chemistry)/3
    print("your average score is",avg)
 
 # Optional. 
 """   
if maths >= 35:
    print ('You have passed in Maths exam')
else:
    print("You have failed in Maths exam")

if physics >= 35:
    print ('You have passed in Physics exam')
else:
    print("You have failed in Physics exam")

if chemistry >= 35:
    print ('You have passed in Chemistry exam')
else:
    print("You have failed in Chysics exam")
"""
    
if(avg>=69):
    print("Grade: A")
elif(avg>=59 and avg<68):
    print("Grade: B")
elif(avg>=35 and avg<58):
    print("Grade: C")
else:
    print("Grade: F : You have failed the Exam.")
